# The Freethink Variations
A collection of Python programs built on open-source LLMs, where each variation specializes in a unique task without requiring fine-tuning.

## Variations
- **Alpha**: Prioritizes **accurate responses** to user queries.
- **Beta**: Designed for **origination**, generating new ideas from user specified cases.
- **Delta**: Focuses on **hard coding**, dynamically modifying its own code based on user input.
- **Gamma**: Built for **introspection**, engaging in deep, reflective thought.

## Factors
- Each variation has its own 'factors' python file. The 'factors' files hold different classes and bespoke functions for the particular variation to function.
  For example, ```ft_alpha.py``` has its own factor file, ```ft_alpha_factors.py```

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Open-source LLM 

## How It Works
Each variation leverages an LLM to perform its designated task, offering a modular approach to problem-solving without fine-tuning.
